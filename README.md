# Residue Codes Cryptography
It is a cryptography project using Chinese Remainder Theorem for encryption and decryption.
The given inputs have been matched with the encrypted new values using the Residue Number System.
In this system, it is quite challenging to decrypt due to the fact that the same inputs can result in different
values after encryption.
